# CS 3503 Project 1 - Bitboard Checkers Game

## Author
Darren

## Description
My implementation of Owl Tech ’s BitBoard Game Engine.

## Build Instructions
‘‘‘bash
gcc main.c BitManipulation.c Board.c -o main.exe
./main.exe
‘‘‘

## Directions
1. Have a friend<br>

## Test Results
This Checkers Bitboard game engine has the basic functions of capturing, moving, quitting, and simple win condition of a player having 0 checkers pieces left. With the capturing function allowing for multiple captures in one turn.

## Notes
The hardest part of this project was finding ways to implement successful bit manipulations into functions of the game (capturing, moving, etc.). 
<br>Overall, working on this project has given me a great understanding of bitboards and the applications of bit manipulations on these bitboards.<br>
